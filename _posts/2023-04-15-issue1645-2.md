Cryptomator issue #1645

Please find the first post of this story [here](https://blog.purejava.org/posts/issue1645/).

# Further development
The further development required icons that can be pressed to trigger the tray icon menus and that look good on major Linux desktop environments. I designed SVG icons for that purpose, that scale well on different sizes of task bars and screen resolutions.

On GNOME 43 and KDE 5.24.7 they look like this:

_Tray icons on GNOME 43_

_Tray icons on KDE 5.24.7_

To enable the tray icon functionality for Cryptomator on Linux, you need to enable the appropriate setting in the Cryptomator settings file:
```json
"showTrayIcon": true
```

# Some notes from the development perspective
The `integations-*` API of Cryptomator is capable of handling PNG files (as byte[] streams), but needed to be widened to handle SVG as well:
```diff
   * @param tooltip       Text shown when hovering
   * @throws TrayMenuException thrown when adding the tray icon failed
   */
-  void showTrayIcon(byte[] imageData, Runnable defaultAction, String tooltip) throws TrayMenuException;
+  default void showTrayIcon(byte[] imageData, Runnable defaultAction, String tooltip) throws TrayMenuException {
+    showTrayIcon(imageData, null, defaultAction, tooltip);
+  };
+
+  /**
+   * Displays an icon on the system tray.
+   *
+   * @param imageData     What image to show
+   * @param icon      The icon name of the icon to show. Can be an icon name following
+   *                    the Freedesktop Icon Naming Specification or a path to an icon file
+   * @param defaultAction Action to perform when interacting with the icon directly instead of its menu
+   * @param tooltip       Text shown when hovering
+   * @throws TrayMenuException thrown when adding the tray icon failed
+   */
+  void showTrayIcon(byte[] imageData, String icon, Runnable defaultAction, String tooltip) throws TrayMenuException;
+
+  /**
+   * Updates the icon on the system tray.
+   *
+   * @param imageData What image to show
+   * @throws IllegalStateException thrown when called before an icon has been added
+   */
+  default void updateTrayIcon(byte[] imageData) {
+    updateTrayIcon(imageData, null);
+  };

  /**
   * Updates the icon on the system tray.
   *
   * @param imageData What image to show
+   * @param icon    The icon name of the icon to show. Can be an icon name following

   */
-  void updateTrayIcon(byte[] imageData);
+  void updateTrayIcon(byte[] imageData, String icon);

  /**

```

On a [review](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/pull/2862) of my code contribution to this issue the Cryptomator devs suggested to use **JDK 20** already for coding. I used **JDK 19** (preview) for coding the change. **JDK 20** was released shorty before and the Cryptomator project will move to it.
Coding with **JDK 19** (preview) makes it impossible to load compiled classes from **JDK 20**.

As soon as **JDK 20** will be available on Arch Linux, I'll migrate my code to **JDK 20**.
