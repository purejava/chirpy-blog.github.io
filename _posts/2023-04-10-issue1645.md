Cryptomator issue #1645

# Motivation
I really love **Cryptomator**. I love the software, that protects my sensitive data in the cloud. And I love the project, that's Java with state of the art techniques, **A** code quality and they accept contributions.

Most of my contributions to the project are features I considered missing or nice to have. So is this one.

There was a bug report for this issue already ([#1645](https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/1645)) and the **Cryptomator** devs suggest to make the C library **libappindicator** available to the software. This would improve the tray icon support for **Cryptomator**. The current tray icon menu on Linux doesn't look nice and the tray icon isn't displayed properly.

# Requirements
To get **libappindicator** work with **Cryptomator**, Java bindings are needed. Their implementation could be done via JNI or JNA, but I decided for the Foreign Function & Memory API (FFI) as a state of the art approach. The Java bindings could be generated [with jextract](https://blog.purejava.org/posts/jextract-on-libappindicator/).

Luckily I gained the necessary experience on how callbacks do work with the FFI by writing the Java bindings for [WinSparkle](https://github.com/purejava/winsparkle-java).

# Design
Analyzing the **Cryptomator** code base showed, that there is an `AwtTrayMenuController`, that is responsible to handle the tray icon. This could be supplemented with an `AppindicatorTrayMenuController`, that also implements the `TrayMenuController` and talks to **libappindicator** to use its tray icon functionality.


The code looks quite similar to JNA-Code, as the C library methods are addressed directly (via FFI of course):
```java
private void addChildren(MemoryAddress menu, List<TrayMenuItem> items) {
  for (var item : items) {
    // TODO: use Pattern Matching for switch, once available
    if (item instanceof ActionItem a) {
      var gtkMenuItem = gtk_menu_item_new();
      gtk_menu_item_set_label(gtkMenuItem, MemoryAllocator.ALLOCATE_FOR(a.title()));
      g_signal_connect_object(gtkMenuItem,
          MemoryAllocator.ALLOCATE_FOR("activate"),
          MemoryAllocator.ALLOCATE_CALLBACK_FOR(new ActionItemCallback(a), session),
          menu,
          0);
      gtk_menu_shell_append(menu, gtkMenuItem);
    } else if (item instanceof SeparatorItem) {
      var gtkSeparator = gtk_menu_item_new();
      gtk_menu_shell_append(menu, gtkSeparator);
    } else if (item instanceof SubMenuItem s) {
      var gtkMenuItem = gtk_menu_item_new();
      var gtkSubmenu = gtk_menu_new();
      gtk_menu_item_set_label(gtkMenuItem, MemoryAllocator.ALLOCATE_FOR(s.title()));
      addChildren(gtkSubmenu, s.items());
      gtk_menu_item_set_submenu(gtkMenuItem, gtkSubmenu);
      gtk_menu_shell_append(menu, gtkMenuItem);
    }
    gtk_widget_show_all(menu);
  }
}
```

# Implementation part one
The first step was to call **libappindicator**-methods from the Java code, that show the tray icon menu using D-Bus functionality.
It's very nice, that tray icon menus are displayed with **Gtk** classes, that look native on a Linux desktop environment like GNOME.

The finished first part does look very neat:
